/**
 * Class BouncingBall - a graphical ball that observes the effect of gravity.
 * The ball has the ability to move. Details of movement are determined by the
 * ball itself. It will fall downwards, accelerating with time due to the effect
 * of gravity, and bounce upward again when hitting the ground.
 *
 * This movement can be initiated by repeated calls to the "move" method.
